# Dependency Injection

This project is a fairly comprehensive example of what Dependency Injection would look like for an MVC project. The key example starts in the HomeController where you gather data from a Service, and the data that comes back depends on the IPersistable that you give the Service. 

The project contains a few READMEs and plenty of comments to describe what's going on.
